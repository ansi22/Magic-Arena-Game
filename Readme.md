## Magic-Arena-Game

### Problem Statement:

> Design a Magical Arena. Every Player is defined by a “health” attribute, “strength” attribute, and an “attack” attribute - all positive integers. The player dies if his health attribute touches 0.

> Any two players can fight a match in the arena. Players attack in turns. The attacking player rolls the attacking dice and the defending player rolls the defending dice. The “attack”  value multiplied by the outcome of the  attacking dice roll is the damage created by the attacker. The defender's “strength” value, multiplied by the outcome of the defending dice is the damage defended by the defender. Whatever damage is created by the attacker which is in excess of the damage defended by the defender will reduce the “health” of the defender. The game ends when any player's health reaches 0.

> Player with lower health attacks first at the start of a match.
